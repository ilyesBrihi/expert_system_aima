``ipythonblocks`` is a teaching tool for use with the IPython_ Notebook.
It provides a ``BlockGrid`` object whose representation is an HTML table.
Individual table cells are represented by ``Block`` objects that have ``.red``,
``.green``, and ``.blue`` attributes by which the color of that cell can be
specified.

``ipythonblocks`` allows students to experiment with Python flow control concepts
and immediately see the effects of their code represented in a colorful,
attractive way. ``BlockGrid`` objects can be indexed and sliced like 2D NumPy
arrays making them good practice for learning how to access arrays.

See these demo notebooks for more on using ``ipythonblocks``:

* `Practicing with RGB`_
* `Basic usage`_ with explanations
* `Fun examples`_
* `Animation`_
* `ImageGrid`_
* Going from a `JPEG to BlockGrid`_ and text
* A programatic `firework animation`_
* `Using ipythonblocks.org`_

Install
-------

``ipythonblocks`` can be installed with ``pip``::

    pip install ipythonblocks

However, the package is contained in a single ``.py`` file and if you prefer
you can just grab `ipythonblocks.py`_ and copy it to wherever you
want to use it (useful for packaging with other teaching materials).

Dependencies
------------

Required dependencies:

* Python_ >= 2.7
* IPython_

Optional dependencies:

* requests_ >= 1.0 (for posting and getting to/from `ipythonblocks.org`_)
* Pillow_ (for creating images)

Testing dependencies:

* pytest_ >= 2.3, (for the test suite, see below)
* responses_ >= 0.1
* mock_ (dependency of responses)

Demo dependencies:

* PIL_ (for ``starry_night_to_text.ipynb``)


Testing
-------

The test suite is written using pytest_, so you can run the test suite
with::

    py.test
